function makeFullName(first, last) {

    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.name = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
}
//prompt was to fix a given function
//tbqh i have no idea what i did, but it worked!
//i think the problem was having a 'return' statement on a constructor function?
